== About ==
  The Owl Platform Java Aggregator (aggregator) is one of the primary
  components of the system, providing aggregation and filtering of sensor
  data streams.  Solvers are able to subscribe to sensor data through the
  aggregator without worrying about the deployment details of the backing
  sensor networks.
